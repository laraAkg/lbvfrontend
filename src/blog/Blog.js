            React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library
            for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a
            community of individual developers and companies.

          <p>
            React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or
            mobile applications, as it is optimal for fetching rapidly changing
            data that needs to be recorded. However, fetching data is only the
            beginning of what happens on a web page, which is why complex React
            applications usually require the use of additional libraries for
            state management, routing, and interaction with an API: Redux, React
            Router and axios are examples of such libraries.
